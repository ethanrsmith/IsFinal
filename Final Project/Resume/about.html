                        <p><h2>Early Life</h2>
                            Son of Matthew and Alysa Smith, Ethan was born and raised in North Kingstown in southern Rhode Island. In middle and high school, he played many sports, including basketball, cross country, volleyball, and spikeball. He also played the piano since he was little and learned the tuba as a member of the band.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            <h2>Academics</h2>
                            At North Kingstown High School, Ethan excelled in the classroom. His grades and integrity earned him a spot in the National Honors Society. He studied hard and earned a 32 on the ACT and the equivalent of a 33 on the SAT. He was accepted in 2021 to Brigham Young University and began that very summer. His plan is to major in Accounting and graduate in 2027.

                            <h2>Missionary Service</h2>
                            You may have noticed that his graduation year from Brigham Young University is 6 years after he graduated high school. This is because in 2022 and 2023, he took two years away from his education to serve a full time, non-profit mission for the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints, of which he has been a member since a child. He was assigned to labor in Cuiaba, Brazil and there, served and taught about Jesus Christ.
                            
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            <h2>Goals</h2>
                            Ethan plans on continuing to develop skills in accountancy, information systems, language, and other skills that become useful in the world of business. He also plans on becoming more well rounded, increasing musical and athletic abilites and taking advantage of his time at Brigham Young University to learn about other topics. In the spring of 2025, he will be participating in an Asia study abroad program where he will visit many places in East Asia, including Mongolia, Taiwan, Hong Kong and Japan. In the future, Ethan hopes to use his accounting degree and possibly further schooling to earn a good living and support a family.
